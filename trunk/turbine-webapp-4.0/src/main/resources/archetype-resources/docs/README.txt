About this archetype 

Turbine Version: Turbine 4.0. 

# Quick Guide to using the new Turbine 4.0 maven archetype 
for skeleton application generation

## Local database Setup

First, you should have a local database installed and configured prior to 
beginning the application setup below.

As we are using MySQL bey default you need to create the database in MySQL, e.g. with

mysql -u <user> -p
mysql> create database helloWorld;
mysql> \q

or other tools. The database should have been started and the database user granted enough rights.

## Maven archetype 

Next, you can invoke the Maven archetype for turbine-webapp-4.0 from 
the command line as shown below - please update values starting 
with 'groupId' as appropriate.

mvn archetype:generate \
  -DarchetypeGroupId=org.apache.turbine \
  -DarchetypeArtifactId=turbine-webapp-4.0 \
  -DarchetypeVersion=1.0.1-SNAPSHOT \
  -DgroupId=com.mycompany.webapp \
  -DartifactId=myhelloworld \
  -Dversion=1.0 \
  -Dturbine_app_name=HelloWorld \
  -Dturbine_database_adapter=mysql \
  -Dturbine_database_user=db_username \
  -Dturbine_database_password=db_password \
  -Dturbine_database_name=helloworld \
  -Dturbine_database_url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/ \
  -Dgoals=generate-sources,pre-integration-test

### Notes

When invoking archetype:generate like above, you already have set Turbine goals generate-sources,pre-integration-test 
and you can then skip them later.

Be aware, when you set both mvn commands goals (which are maven phases actually), i.e  with

-Dgoals=generate-sources, pre-integration-test 

you have to create the database (see above) before finishing the (interactive) archetype commands. 
Otherwise you could catch up doing this later and after that is done calling the phases afterwards as mentioned below.

#### turbine_database_url

Note that the database URL (turbine_database_url) 
will be appended with your database name
in the final pom.xml, so you do not need to specify that in 
the configuration.

## Project Start and Usage

Next, change into the newly generated project folder, in our case

cd myhelloworld

Skip next two steps, if the build was successfull
mvn generate-sources  ## This will generate the OM layer and SQL 
          ## code for creating the corresponding
          ## database tables

mvn integration-test      ## This executes the SQL code to create 
          ## the application schema defined 
          ## in src/main/torque-schema

You should now check the database tables and if some data is missing
insert the sample data file in sample-mysql-data (Torque 4.0 has disabled the datasql task).

mvn clean install 

If you get an error like "The driver has not received any packets" probably the database is not up and running or the port may be another one.

Last step on the command line is run the server by invoking 
mvn jetty:run         ## Now you can launch your new Turbine application

### Logs 

Find the Logs in src/main/webapp/logs and

### Application

Open a web browser to http://localhost:8081/app

Login should work with user admin/password or user/password.

## Background

By default Intake is used as an validation mechanism for authentication. You can change to the default login by setting

action.login=LoginUser in TurbineResources.properties and changing Login.vm appropriately (commented form)

## Tests

Prerequisites
- ignored tests require at least Turbine version 4.0.1 
- database was build successfully e.g. with archetype.
- running mysql

If running from integration test, check/update
- in pom.xml turbine.core property,
- target/test-classes/projects/first/project/integrationtest/src/test/conf/torque/TorqueTest.properties or
  META-INF/maven/archetype-metadata.xml

The security test is by default skipped as it requires a running mysql. It tests many of the Fulcrum Torque Turbine security aspects, 
activate it by calling

mvn test -DskipTests=false

CAVEAT: If initialization fails, double check your database credentials! If invalid the error might be somewhat hidden behind a
 Torque exception!

## Eclipse

To enable application development in Eclipse, run the following command 
and then import the project into Eclipse.

mvn eclipse:eclipse

Once imported, update your project to be managed by Maven 
-> Right click on the project name
-> Configure 
-> Convert to Maven project

To test the application can be deployed by Eclipse, select the run
configuration "Run On Server" if you have a container configured with
your eclipse environment.

### Eclipse Debugging

You even could debug the app by setting the environment variable to something like this

set MAVEN_OPTS=-Xdebug -Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_socket,address=8787,server=y,suspend=n

before running the jetty server.

## Starting developing

Be aware of settings and some smaller restrictions, which mostly will be fixed in the upcoming releases.

- Keep groups/roles lower case (which should be fixed in Fulcrum Security 1.1.1/Turbine 4.0)
- abstract classes and managers are included (because of some minor bugs in Fulcrum Security 1.1.0, same as above)
- LogoutUser action is included (fix in Turbine 4.0, getUserFromSession)
- LoginUser action is included (to check for anonymous user, may be fixed in future release)
- OM (Torque Object Mapper) stub classes are included (until configurable in schema with Torque version 2.1)
- TurbineConfiguration returns a Commons configuration object, even if field is not assignable (will be fixed in Turbine 4.0, you can then assign e.g. to String instead, cft. SecureScreen)
- Database connection is done initially by default with JNDI. If you want to change it, check Torque.properties and (1) for Tomcat, META-INF/context.xml or (2) for Jetty, WEB-INF/jetty-env.xml.
